Some comments:
1.	“add item” use case should include the function of removing the duplicate items (5)
2.	“remove item” use case should include the function of removing the special items (5)
3.	“update item” use case should be able to update the times with the item number (5)
4.	“activity diagram” – end point notation error; “display item” has two options so you can’t use “fork”; and the same errors on the other two places using “fork” (5)
